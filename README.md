        <small>
            Since by design this extension requires a local copy of an ip→country database, it is essential that during development you provide it with one.
            You'll have to obtain a license key in order to use MaxMind GeoIP database.
            Refer to their blog (linked above) for more info on how to register for a free license key.

        <small>
            Some of the build steps in the codebase rely on <code>jq</code> being available in the system.
            Please refer to their website (linked above) for more details on how to install <code>jq</code> in your OS.

## 📦 Building

Make sure your MaxMind license key is available to the build script:

```sh
export MAXMIND_LICENSE_KEY=REPLACE_THIS_WITH_YOUR_KEY
```

Then just run:

```sh
make -j
```

Or, if you don't intend to do it often, then just do a one-liner:

```sh
MAXMIND_LICENSE_KEY=REPLACE_THIS_WITH_YOUR_KEY make -j
```

The default Make target downloads and builds all relevant assets and puts them inside the `./bundle` directory.

Subsequent builds can be significantly faster if you later use `build` target specifically:

```sh
make build
```

## 🛠️ Development

Download and install dependencies:

```sh
npm i && make bundle/data
```

Run the watch mode:

```sh
npm start
```

<small>While it's building you may want to check out how to [load an unpacked extension](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/faq#faq-dev-01) in Google Chrome.</small>

Once it's built you will be able to load it from the `./bundle` directory.
